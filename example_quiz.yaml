        answers:
          - text: I agree to follow the rules
            correct: true
          - text: I don't like the rules
            post_text: That is unfortunate. If you decide later that you can deal with the rules, please come back.
      - order: 2
        text: Let's take a minute to check that you really did read and understand the rules. **When are you allowed to ask about account hacking in the server?**
        timeout: 300
        timeout_text: It looks like you took more than 5 minutes to answer the question. Feel free to come back another time when you have time to read the rules! You will be kicked in 10 seconds!
        timeout_audit: Took too long to answer account hacking question

        fail_count: 2
        fail_audit: Couldn't answer account hacking question
        randomize_answers: true
        answers:
          - text: Never
            correct: true
            post_text: That's correct!
          - text: When it's my account
            post_text: That's incorrect. If you have an account on a service, and the account has been hacked or hijacked, your only option is to work with the support team of that service. Trying to hack an account on a service, even if you own the account, is still considered an attack on the service itself!
          - text: When it belongs to a bad person
            post_text: That's incorrect. Two wrongs don't make a right. Trying to hack an account on a service is considered an attack on the service itself, regardless of the person who owns the account!
          - text: When I'm hacking it back for someone
            post_text: That's incorrect. If you have an account on a service, and the account has been hacked or hijacked, your only option is to work with the support team of that service. Trying to hack an account on a service, even if you own the account, is still considered an attack on the service itself!
      - order: 3
        text: One last question. **When you have a question, where should you post it?**
        timeout: 300
        timeout_text: It looks like you took more than 5 minutes to answer the question. Feel free to come back another time when you have time to read the rules! You will be kicked in 10 seconds!
        timeout_audit: Took too long to answer channel selection question
        fail_text: It looks like you didn't really read the rules. If you decide later that you want to read the rules, come on back!

        fail_audit: Couldn't answer account channel selection question
        randomize_answers: true
        answers:
          - text: In the channel that most closely matches the topic
            correct: true
            post_text: That's correct!
          - text: In as many channels as possible
            post_text: That's incorrect. Please limit posts to a single channel. Posting in multiple channels just makes for chaos when multiple people start answering in multiple places.
          - text: In whatever channel I am in
            post_text: That's incorrect. Please try to post questions in the most appropriate channel. Some people only monitor the channels that they have knowledege in, and questions they might be able to answer could be missed if they are in the wrong channel.
          - text: In a DM
            post_text: That's incorrect. We try to avoid DMs as much as possible in the server, as they make it so others can't learn from questions that have been asked previously.
